# Tokens

Privacy-preserving tokens are a type of cryptographic token used in some privacy-enhancing systems, such as anonymous credential systems or privacy-preserving authentication protocols. These tokens enable users to prove their identity or eligibility for certain privileges or services without revealing additional identifying information or personal data.

The tokens are generated using cryptographic techniques that enable the service provider to verify the authenticity and validity of the token without actually learning the user's identity or other sensitive information to help protect user privacy while enabling secure and efficient interactions with services or systems.
