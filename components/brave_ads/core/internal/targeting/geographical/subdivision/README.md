# Subdivision Targeting

Subdivision targeting in the context of ads refers to the practice of delivering ads to users based on their geographical location at a more granular level than just the country. This could be a state, province, city, or even a specific neighborhood.

See [ISO_3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) for a list of assigned subdivisions.
