# URL Request Builder

URL request builders are used to construct URLs programmatically. A URL builder
typically takes in various input parameters, such as the host name, path, query
string, and other parameters, and combines them into a well-formed URL. This can
be useful in situations where URLs need to be constructed dynamically.
